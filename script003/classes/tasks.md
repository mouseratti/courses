Define class ‘Order’ that implements following behavior/attributes:  
1. Keeps track of the date and time when it was created (created_at
attribute, use `@property`)  
1. Every order has an internal ID that is random generated when Order is
instantiated – (20 chars from char pools A-Z,1-9).  
Use `string.ascii_uppercase`  
1. User should be able to compare orders based on created_at value.
Older orders are ‘bigger’
