1.  Descending Order  
Create a function that can take any non-negative 
integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
Examples:  
   Input: _21445_ Output: _54421_  
   Input: _145263_ Output: _654321_  
   Input: _1254859723_ Output: _9875543221_
