1. Summarize the powers  
With given N count the result of this expression:
1^3+2^3+3^3+...+n^3

1. FizzBuzz game  
   Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.
   But for multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number
   For the multiples of 5 print “Buzz”.
   For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz” instead.

1. Fibonacci sequence  
   With given N found the  N-th Fibonacci number.   
   For example:  
   5th number will be 1,1,2,3,5 - > 5

1. Is divide by?  
create function `is_divide_by` to check 
if an integer number is divisible 
by each out of two arguments.  
(-12, 2, -6)  ->  true  
(-12, 2, -5)  ->  false  
(45, 1, 6)    ->  false  
(45, 5, 15)   ->  true  
(4, 1, 4)     ->  true  
(15, -5, 3)   ->  true


1. Write a funtion to print the index of the character in a string.  
   Sample string: Chevron  
        Expected output:  
        Current character C position at 0  
        Current character h position at 1  
        Current character e position at 2

from the beginning of the day to the actual time
returned result should be a string formatted as _HH:mm:ss_

1. write a function that hides all vovels from given string:
